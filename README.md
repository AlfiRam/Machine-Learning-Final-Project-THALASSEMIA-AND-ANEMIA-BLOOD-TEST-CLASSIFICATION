# Machine-Learning-Final-Project-THALASSEMIA-AND-ANEMIA-BLOOD-TEST-CLASSIFICATION

As the final project of the IUP Machine Learning Class, our goal is to create a 
high-accuracy machine learning model that effectively calssifies patients' blood test
data into Anemia class or Thalassemia class using a dataset comprising patients' blood
